;; eventually, a splash screen or function that calls zone with some sort of
;; s-expression slider.

;; e.g. pick a random buffer from recentf that is clojure or lisp (or a
;; default vizier file), insert that into the zone / splash buffer, then call
;; random sp-functions on them to manipulate it in one of those sliding-puzzle
;; kind of ways.

;; yee haw.
